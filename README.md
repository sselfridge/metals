# metals

Homework from the scammyest company I ever interviewed for....turns out it was just a front to scam old people out of money by selling them gold or whatever.

The guy who I imagine is the mastermind was the closest thing to the matrix guy from grandmas boy I've ever seen - didn't talk to him, but saw him walking around in very sparkely boots and then go into the glass walled office with at least 4 extra large monitors surrouding him.


But I was decently happy with my work on the assignment, only thing I've ever done in Vue and first time using AWS API gateway

But I'm really tired of getting security notifications about this, so hopefully archiveing this repo will fix that.
